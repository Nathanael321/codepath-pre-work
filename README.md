Submitted by: Nathanael Temesgen

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/codepath-int-prework?path=README.md%3A7%3A13

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] User has a limited amount of time to complete the game

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

    I used [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to help me complete my submission.
    
2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

    When completing this assignment, I had noticed that there were a few moments I didn’t know what I was coding. I wanted to make sure I understood everything that I was doing so that I could use this pre-work as a learning experience in itself. In trying to overcome this, for a few of the parts of the assignment, I had tried to avoid simply copy and pasting the program so that I could implement certain things myself, but because I didn’t know too much of HTML and CSS, I sometimes had to go back and look at the code provided. Although this process was quite tiresome, I was able to acquire an understanding of the languages used (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that I didn’t have as much before. I can honestly say that I can go on ahead and create my own project using these languages, without having to outsource as much as I would have prior to having done this assignment. 

    Another challenge was adding a timer that ended the game if it were to have reached 0:00. There were a lot of complications that I came across -- such as knowing how to stop the timer, ending the game when the timer had reached 0:00, etc. In trying to figure this out, I looked at the functions functionality and other programs that had implemented the functions that I was recommended to use (setInterval and clearInterval). Using these programs, I studied when, and how, these functions were called and tried to apply them to my program. In doing so, I was able to completely implement an effective timer using the knowledge gained from doing the required portion of this assignment and outsourcing.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    Most of the remaining questions that I have for web development is how can I make websites/applications look fancier than the one I created for this assignment. How can I make the site more professional/look like other, well-known, sites. I want to be able to create something that can be of great use to society, while looking as fancy as the sites that are out there today. Beyond that: what are the responsibilities of a web developer? How do you optimize and reduce web application load time? What steps do you take to balance demanding client requirements? How do you determine if a website is worth creating? What should be the main muse for web development?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    For starters, if I hadn’t had taken up so much time on the clock, I would’ve tried to apply sounds that are a little more pleasant to the ear than those tones (possible more melodic tones). Reason being is because I want to be able to use my own “assets” that I can find online and implement it to my website. I also would try to change the timer so that the user had a certain amount of time to guess after a clue has been played. I would’ve also tried to make the winning/losing pop-up look more flashier so that it would look more pleasing to the eye (probably add confetting when winning and an animation of text saying “Game Over!” slowly fading in at the bottom of the screen).
